                            Library Functions Manual -  _printf 

NAME
       _printf - formatted output conversion

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
 #include <stdio.h>
    int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
    The functions in the printf() family produce output according to a
    format as described below.

    Format of the format string :
    The format string contains ordinary characters (copied unchanged) and conversion specifications 
    starting with % and ending with a conversion specifier.

CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
     A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
       The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

    c      Prints a single character.
            Takes an int argument and converts it to a character.

    s      Prints a string of characters.
            Takes a char * argument pointing to a null-terminated string. 
            If the string is NULL, prints "(null)".

    d, i   Prints a signed decimal integer.
            Takes an int argument and converts it to decimal notation. Both %d and %i work identically.

    %      Prints a literal '%' character. No argument is consumed. Use %% to print a single %.

RETURN VALUE
    Upon successful return, these functions return the number of bytes printed 
    (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

EXAMPLES

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello\n");
    _printf("%d", 39);
    _printf("%s", "This is a string");
    _printf("%c", H);

    return (0);
}
